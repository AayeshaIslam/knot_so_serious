## 🌟 RiseUp with ServiceNow Project

### 🧐 Problem  
Across the land, talented crochet and knitting vendors are stitching away… but their business tools are a tangled mess of spreadsheets, sticky notes, and Instagram DMs.  

- 🛑 Many local artisans struggle to find a **simple, affordable platform** to sell handmade products, track inventory, and manage orders.  
- 💸 Existing marketplaces are often **too complex or expensive**.  
- 🔍 Customers struggle to **find trustworthy, pre-vetted vendors** in one central location.  
- 📉 This creates friction for both vendors and customers and **limits growth for small creators**.
